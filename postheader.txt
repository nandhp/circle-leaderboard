Here's a leaderboard of the largest active and betrayed circles at the
[end of the Circle of Trust](https://redd.it/8aaxa6), along with the
users who joined the most circles.

**Size** is the number of people who joined the circle. For circles
with enough observations available, it links to a chart of size over
time.

**Age** is measured from circle creation to the end of the event (for
active circles), or the time of observation of its betrayal (for
betrayed circles).

The data was gathered by a bot monitoring
[/r/CircleofTrust/top](/r/CircleofTrust/top) (along with hot, top of
hour and rising), along with searches and the comment stream.
Unfortunately, sorting /r/CircleofTrust by top was unreliable, so a
few circles may have gone missing from the data. The data issues
affect both completeness of the data and also accuracy of betrayal
times.

I hope everyone had as much fun with this as I did.
